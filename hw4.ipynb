        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will explore how **Ridge** and **Lasso** regression introduce **bias** into a model to reduce **variance**, and how the choice of the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ affects this trade-off. The goal is to visualize and analyze the **bias-variance trade-off** and understand the conditions under which penalization helps or hinders model performance.\n",

        "## **The Question**\n",
        "\n",
        "**How does varying the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ in Ridge and Lasso regression impact the trade-off between bias and variance?**\n",

        "\n",
        "  use a **high-dimensional** setting (e.g., 50 predictors) with only a few non-zero true coefficients to emphasize the effects of regularization. I stress, the $\\beta_i$ coefficients should be known for this experiment and they should be mostly 0, with only a few non-zero parameters.\n",

        "- Investigate how increasing $\\lambda$ influences the model’s **bias**, **variance**, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.\n",

        "   - **Bias** increases (the model becomes too simple).\n",
        "   - **Variance** decreases (the model becomes more stable).\n",

        "  - Plot **Bias²**, **Variance**, and **MSE** against $\\lambda$ for both models.\n",
        "  - Include a section answering the questions.\n",
        "  - Be well-documented with comments and explanations for each step.\n",
