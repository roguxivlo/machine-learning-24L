        "### **Online Dataset**\n",
        "\n",
        "The code provided below generates an *online* dataset `OddXYDataset`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term *online* means that the dataset does not have a fixed set of pre-generated examples (like a traditional training set of fixed size). Instead, new samples are generated dynamically each time they are requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the number of possible examples is finite in principle, it is so large that — for practical purposes — we can consider it to be effectively infinite.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this setting, there is no need to use a separate validation or test set: the training error itself is a good estimate of the generalization error, since every training sample is new and unseen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consequently, the notion of an *epoch* becomes a matter of convention. For this assignment, we define one epoch as processing 25,000 training examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Training strategies**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting is not a problem in the *online* setting — but training can still stagnate in local minima or flat regions of the loss landscape.  \n",
        "To address this, you will likely need to try one or more of the following strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multiple restarts** with different random seed values;\n",
        "- **Adaptive learning rate** — consider researching training schedulers (this topic was not covered in class);\n",
        "- **Progressive model growth** — start with a simpler architecture and gradually add components during training,\n",
        "  so that the parts already present can learn what to do before the rest is introduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **DataLoader**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `show_examples()` function demonstrate how to wrap the dataset into a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` so it becomes directly usable for the training/testing of a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data Description**\n",
        "\n",
        "By examining the provided code and a few sample images generated from this dataset, you will notice that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Each data sample** is a 64×64 black-and-white image with the following characteristics:\n",
        "  - It contains several shapes of the same type (either circles, triangles, or squares), randomly placed and varying in size;\n",
        "  - It includes one additional shape of a different type — the *odd* shape — also placed at a random location;\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Note that these shapes may overlap partially or even completely, potentially hiding the odd shape.**\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The label** associated with each image is a 2D point indicating the coordinates of the center of the odd shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The Homework Objective**\n",
        "\n",
        "Students should design an architecture of an **attention-based neural network** and train it so that it attains an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error, defined as the square root of the MSE) of **5.0 or lower**. Due to the nature of the online dataset, there is no need to test the solution on a separate test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Students should visualize the attention matrices in the trained network and **discuss what they observe** — not just describe them.  \n",
        "Focus on interpreting the patterns: Where is the model attending? Are there any consistent behaviors across samples? Does attention correlate with the position of the odd shape? What do surprising or unclear patterns tell us?\n",
        "\n",
        "A few technical requirements to observe:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Seed all random number generators so that (1) your results are replicable and (2) I can rerun your solution and obtain the same output — *in case I need to check something*.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Make sure your Colab file contains a **fully trained solution** with:\n",
        "  - printed training output,\n",
        "  - attention diagrams,\n",
        "  - and a plot of the training loss curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, I don’t have to rerun your code unless absolutely necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Publish on GitHub**\n",
        "- Upload your Colab notebook to your **GitHub repository** for this course.\n",
        "- In your repository’s **README**, include a **link** to the notebook.\n",
        "- In the notebook include **“Open in Colab”** badge so the notebook can be launched directly from GitHub.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **SOLUTION SUGGESTIONS**\n",
        "\n",
        "Students **do not need to follow these suggestions** — these are simply the strategies that worked for me.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the homework is, of course, to find the location of the odd shape. For that reason, it seems worthwhile to consider a *position-aware* variant of the post-processing of attention results. The solution I propose consists of the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "0. **Input**  \n",
        "   Our input is a black-and-white image with 1 channel, of size 64×64 pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Embedding**  \n",
        "  In class, we embedded a sequence of tokens in a multidimensional space, resulting in a sequence of embeddings. We also saw how such sequences are compatible with positional encoding and attention mechanisms used in subsequent stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here, we need to process an image that contains shapes of interest at various spatial locations.  \n",
        "  To do this, I designed a Convolutional Neural Network with:\n",
        "  - 1 input channel,\n",
        "  - an input grid of 64x64 pixels,\n",
        "  - and an output feature map arranged as a 12x12 grid with 16 channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "  I used **no padding**, and each output neuron has a **receptive field of size 20x20** with a **stride of 4x4**.  \n",
        "  This architectural choice yields **144 distinct positions** (12x12), each represented by a 16-dimensional feature vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "  We can treat this as a sequence of 144 embeddings in 16-dimensional space — making it fully compatible with the attention mechanisms used later in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Positional Encoding**  \n",
        "  I applied sinusoidal positional encoding, just like in class, using 16 positional dimensions to match the 16 feature dimensions of the image embeddings.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  Positions were encoded based on their indices from 0 to 143.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Attention**  \n",
        "   I used full self-attention, where input tokens are linearly projected into Query, Key, and Value vectors using learned matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Post-Processing**  \n",
        "   The classifier was implemented as a 2-layer MLP and applied **token-wise**, without averaging over positions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "   This corresponds to the **position-aware** variant of post-processing the attention results, as discussed in class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   As a result, the model produced a **logit for each of the 144 spatial locations**, which was then converted with `softmax` into a **probability distribution** over positions — representing the likelihood of the odd shape being located at each position.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Prediction**  \n",
        "   We know the exact position (center) of each of the 144 rectangular receptive fields of the embedding network. Since we also have the **probability** of each field being the target location (from the classifier), we can compute the **expected position** as a weighted average of receptive field centers. In what follows I will call it *soft argmax*.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Suppose we had only 4 output rectangles (instead of 144), with centers at:  \n",
        "   $$(16, 16),\\ (16, 48),\\ (48, 16),\\ \\text{and } (48, 48).$$  \n",
        "   and suppose the probabilities from the post-processing stage were:  \n",
        "   $$(0.1,\\ 0.2,\\ 0.69999,\\ 0.00001).$$  \n",
        "   Then the predicted center would be:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\begin{align*}\n",
        "   x &= 16 \\cdot 0.1 + 16 \\cdot 0.2 + 48 \\cdot 0.69999 + 48 \\cdot 0.00001 \\\\\n",
        "   y &= 16 \\cdot 0.1 + 48 \\cdot 0.2 + 16 \\cdot 0.69999 + 48 \\cdot 0.00001\n",
        "   \\end{align*}\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   which yields an interpretable, differentiable prediction for the (x, y) location of the odd shape (*soft argmax*).\n",
        "\n",
        "**The above steps bring the RMSE below 4.0 pixels.**  \n",
        "However, the result depends on the network initialization — it is seed-dependent — so it's worth restarting the training a few times with different seeds to find a better-performing run.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve this result further, though, we'll have to work a bit harder. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Offset Regressor**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The soft-argmax mechanism in step 5 identifies the **center** of the most probable receptive field, but it cannot fine-tune the prediction within that field. For example, if the odd shape is located in the **lower-left corner** of a receptive field, the best the model can do is predict the **center** of that rectangle — introducing a systematic error.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *One may argue:* the design naturally accounts for a more nuanced case. When the odd shape lies **across the boundary between two receptive fields**, the attention distribution may spread across both regions. In such cases, the soft-argmax prediction becomes a **weighted average** of the centers of the adjacent fields. This behavior is a built-in **feature of the design** that allows the model to predict positions **off-center**, somewhere in between fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *To that I would reply:* this is true — but it comes with a trade-off. When attention is distributed across multiple regions, it becomes **less clear which shapes are *regular* and which one is *odd***. This added ambiguity may make it harder for the network to reach a confident decision, especially in the early stages of training.\n",
        "\n",
        "  To address this systematic limitation in a more structured way, I introduced an additional **2-layer MLP regressor**, applied **token-wise** to each of the 144 positions. This regressor takes the same attention output used by the classifier in step 4 and predicts a **local offset** $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ within each receptive field. These offsets are then **aggregated** using the probabilities from step 4, resulting in a **soft average correction vector**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Note that the attention mechanism must learn to extract — from the original features — both:\n",
        "  - the **probability** that the odd shape is located at a given position, and  \n",
        "  - the **local coordinates** of that shape *within* the respective receptive field.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Refined Prediction**\n",
        "\n",
        "  The final predicted position is obtained by summing the **coarse prediction** from step 5 and the **fine-grained correction** from step 6. This allows the model to make accurate, differentiable predictions at **sub-receptive-field resolution**, resulting in significantly improved localization.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **In summary:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Step 5: predicts the expected center of the relevant receptive field (via soft-argmax);\n",
        "  - Step 6: estimates a fine-grained, attention-weighted offset within that field;\n",
        "  - Step 7: adds both components to produce the final prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{final prediction} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i p_i \\cdot C_i}_{\\text{soft argmax}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i p_i \\cdot (\\Delta x, \\Delta y)_i}_{\\text{fine correction offset}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, I was not able to train this network end-to-end from scratch — it seems that the two heads (the classifier inferring probabilities and the regressor inferring fine-grained corrections) were not able to learn their roles *simultaneously*.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this, I adopted a **progressive model growth** training strategy:\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, I trained a one-headed version of the network (without steps 6 and 7) until the RMSE reached approximately 4.0 — a clear indication that the probability distribution was being inferred correctly.\n",
        "- Then, I copied all weights into a new, complete two-headed network and continued training from that point.\n",
        "\n",
        "**This strategy brought the RMSE down to 2.65 pixels.**\n"
